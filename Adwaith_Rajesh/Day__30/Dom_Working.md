# How Dom actually works

# Dom act as a interface between the javascript code and the browser or html documents that are rendered by the browser

```bash

� Allows us to make JavaScript interact with the browser;

� We can write JavaScript to create, modify and delete HTML elements;
set styles, classes and attributes; and listen and respond to events;

� DOM tree is generated from an HTML document, which we can then
interact with;

� DOM is a very complex API that contains lots of methods and
properties to interact with the DOM tree

```

```javascript

.querySelector() / .addEventListener() / .createElement() /
.innerHTML / .textContent / .children / etc ..

```
