How to contribute

1: Fork this repository

2:Clone your repository that you are forked

	
      git remote add origin https://github.com/<Your github Name>/100daysOfCode.git
     

3: Before you make any changes, keep your fork in sync to avoid merge conflicts:
	
	
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/<Your github Name>/100daysOfCode.git
        git pull upstream master/main
    

4:After adding the upstream and checking that all files are up to date, we now will create newbranch before editing any files. There are two ways to do so:
	
	
        git checkout -b <branch-name> (Preferrably your Name)
        git checkout <branch-name>
     

5:Commit the changes that you made

	
     git commit -m "Add your message/changes you made"

     

6:Finally push the changes to the repository

	
      git push origin <your branch name>
